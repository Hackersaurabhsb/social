The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:

Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))

# Several social services will not allow redirecting users to 127.0.0.1 or localhost after 
# successful authentication; they expect a domain name for the URL redirect. First, we need to use a 
# domain name to make social authentication work.

#The static() helper function is suitable for development but not for production use. Django is very inefficient
#  at serving static files. Never serve your static files with Django in a production environment.
